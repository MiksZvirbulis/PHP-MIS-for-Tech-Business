## Purpose
While working for a company that builds custom built PC's, I was given permission put my hobby to the test and create an internal Management Interface System (MIS) for the company. Here my challenge was to create a database and management system that allowed amending, deleting, adding and moving stock. Creating customers, orders, purchases, shipments, office times, email templates, sms templates (using a Text2Reach API), salaries, credits (RMA's), shipment companies & methods. This improved the business by having less paperwork, create useful graphs, remote access and automated communication systems.
